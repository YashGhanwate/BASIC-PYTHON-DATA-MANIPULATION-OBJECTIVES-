### BASIC-PYTHON-DATA-MANIPULATION-OBJECTIVES :

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It features dynamic typing, making it flexible for various tasks. Basic Python syntax includes indentation for code blocks and the use of colons to denote the beginning of control flow statements like loops and conditionals. Variables are dynamically typed, eliminating the need for explicit declarations. Python supports various data types like integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Functions are defined using the 'def' keyword, and modules can be imported to extend functionality. Python's extensive standard library offers modules for diverse purposes, making it suitable for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

### String Indexing:

---Sting indexing, also known as "sting," is a technique used in information retrieval systems to
   efficiently locate and retrieve relevant data from large volumes of text or documents.
---It involves three main steps: sifting, thresholding, and indexing.
---First, irrelevant data is filtered out through sifting, then remaining terms are scored based on relevance in thresholding,
   and finally, indexed for efficient retrieval.
---This method balances precision and recall, improving the speed and accuracy of information retrieval systems.

Q1) How can you access the first character of a string using indexing?
