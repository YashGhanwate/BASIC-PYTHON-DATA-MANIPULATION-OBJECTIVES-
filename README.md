### BASIC-PYTHON-DATA-MANIPULATION-OBJECTIVES :

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It features dynamic typing, making it flexible for various tasks. Basic Python syntax includes indentation for code blocks and the use of colons to denote the beginning of control flow statements like loops and conditionals. Variables are dynamically typed, eliminating the need for explicit declarations. Python supports various data types like integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Functions are defined using the 'def' keyword, and modules can be imported to extend functionality. Python's extensive standard library offers modules for diverse purposes, making it suitable for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

### String Indexing:

---Sting indexing, also known as "sting," is a technique used in information retrieval systems to
   efficiently locate and retrieve relevant data from large volumes of text or documents.
---It involves three main steps: sifting, thresholding, and indexing.
---First, irrelevant data is filtered out through sifting, then remaining terms are scored based on relevance in thresholding,
   and finally, indexed for efficient retrieval.
---This method balances precision and recall, improving the speed and accuracy of information retrieval systems.

Q1) How can you access the first character of a string using indexing?

#### Pandas Module:
.
---The Pandas module in Python provides powerful data manipulation and analysis tools, primarily through 
   its DataFrame data structure. 
---It offers functionality for handling structured data, including reading and writing various file formats, data cleaning,
   filtering, grouping, and statistical analysis. 
---Syntax: import pandas as pd. 
---Pandas is widely used in data science and analytics for tasks like data preprocessing, exploration,
   and visualization, making it an essential tool in the Python ecosystem for working with tabular data efficiently 
   and effectively.

Q2)2.Given a Pandas DataFrame sales_data containing sales information (date, product, quantity, and price), write Python code to:
Calculate the total sales amount (quantity * price) for each row and add it as a new column named "total_sales".
Group the DataFrame by product and calculate the total sales amount for each product.
Sort the resulting DataFrame by total sales amount in descending order.
